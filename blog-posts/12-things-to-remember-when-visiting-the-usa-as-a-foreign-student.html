                                planning to come to the United States might find useful, as mentioned earlier on my other
                                blog and bio that I’m of African descent. I came to the U.S. in 2012 on a foreign cultural
                                exchange program, and I’ve been here ever since. Coming to America was an exciting opportunity
                                I ever encounter on my own. I was ecstatic to get a chance to be in America on my own as
                                my previous travel experience has been with the family. With that being said, there was a
                                time I’d spend long hours every day searching the net for tips, to help me survive in the
                                USA. Therefore, I’m about to share things to remember when immigrating or visiting the United
                                States.

                                                an American family and be attending college, you will have to learn the “standard

                                                talking about “the American dream.” I once asked my friends what is REALLY
                                                “The American Dream” while they all gave me a different definition, but the
                                                concept was quite clear. It’s simply explained as the ability to improve
                                                one’s socio-economic standard, through hard work. If you are willing to put
                                                in work and be dedicated to what you do, you too can achieve the American

                                                when you’re traveling over here, make sure you are carrying an excellent
                                                health insurance. America has an advanced medical technology, and it's one
                                                of the countries that have the best doctors, but the American healthcare
                                                system is questionable and has so many loopholes. I would recommend you carry
                                                an international travel health insurance, which includes air ambulance back

                                                tipping your server after the service has been received. Americans are a
                                                number one tippers, and with that, they have made minimum wage jobs worthy.

                                                came through to America made sure to discuss. Since I’m a foreigner and couldn’t

                                            <p class="card-text">I should probably say NEVER bribe! If you ever found yourself
                                                in a position of being pulled over by a cop in the U.S.A., do not offer money
                                                to a cop. For many people, including myself who are from countries that government
                                                workers, especially law enforcement workers, strive on receiving bribes.
                                                In America, offering a bribe to a law enforcement agent to avoid a penalty
                                                is a felony, and you will be immediately put to jail for it. If you found
                                                yourself in that unfortunate position, calm down and do as the officer ask
                                                you. Do not be a smarty pants, especially when you’re from African ancestors.
                                                If you’ve been keeping up with the international news, you are aware that
                                                there has been an uprising on the issue where cops are shooting innocent
                                                African Americans who were mistaken for posing a threat to a member of law

                                                challenging to start over in a foreign country, with no friends, your own
                                                family, and all you have is your foreign host family. There will be a point
                                                where you feel so homesick and exasperated that you will cry yourself to
                                                sleep. You would long to talk to a friend or your own family, but you really
                                                don’t want to worry them, so you will learn to tough it out; so throughout

                                                been there, done that. Don’t worry, you will soon have those friendships
